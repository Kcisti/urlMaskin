# Presentation
Python algorithm for URL Masking. It’s like having a digital camouflage to protect you online!

What you can do:
  - Secure Masking: Hides real URLs behind seemingly harmless links.
  - Privacy Protection: Keep URLs you don’t want to share publicly secret.
  - Attack Prevention: Reduce the risk of cyber attacks through malicious links.
  
How it Works:
  - Enter the URL to Mask: Copy and paste the URL you want to hide.
  - Generate the Masked Link: The algorithm creates a new URL that redirects to the original site.
  - Share in Security: Share the masked link without worrying about your privacy.
  
# Tested on platforms:
  - Windows
  - Linux
